# Retrograde-motion
This contains python programs to simulate the orbit of planets and show the retrograde motion.
I have used datasets from JPL and used ASTROPY to import and process the data and to save the data in a csv file 
Link to the datasets: bsp files(binary SPICE planetary ephemeris file)
